        REIMAGINING THIRD PLACES: CREATING EPHEMERAL MOMENTS OF CONNECTION IN OUR EVERYDAY LIVES
    </h1>

    <h2>
        What are Third Places?
    </h2>
    Typically, third places are known as “informal public gathering spaces” outside of our home (first place) and work (second place). Ie: Libraries, cafes, beaches, gyms.
    <br>
    <br>
    This term was first coined by <a href="https://www.pps.org/article/roldenburg">Ray Oldenburg</a>, an Urban Sociologist in 1989. He observed that:
    <br>
    <br>
    "The character of a third place is determined most of all by its regular clientele and is <b>marked by a playful mood,</b> which contrasts with people's more serious involvement in other spheres... They are <b>the heart of a community's social vitality…</b>”

    <h2>
        What is the Relevance to Vancouver Today?  
    </h2>
    <i>Commentary on Vancouver's Cultural Landscape
    </i>
    <br>
    <br>
    A shared sentiment by a notable amount of people on Vancouver’s cultural landscape is that we are “nice, but distant.” Our friendly and courteous manner has led to a lack of social intimacy, or an increase of social distance. We are exceptionally polite, but we keep people at arms length - our emphasis on friendliness and politeness sometimes stifles our opportunities to step outside of the social norms, to create connection outside the routine of niceties that we have all learned to participate in. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Ray Oldenburg said it first, that the third places are “the heart of a community’s social vitality”. Third places provide neutral, non-hierarchical, casual spaces for people to <b>build connection, form bonds, enhance community.</b>
    
    <h2>
        Our Proposition: Reimagining Third Places 
    </h2>
    <u>Dimensions of third places:</u>
        <br>

        Structured (Intentional) ↔ Unstructured (Unintentional)
        <br>
        Concert vs Cafe
        <br>
        <br>
        Linked to Physical Location ↔ Portable, Not Linked to Location
        <br>
        Beach vs Run Club
        <br>
        <br>
        Continuous, Consistent ↔ Spontaneous, Pop Up
        <br>
        Library vs Kiss and Ride
        <br>
        <br>
        Synchronous ↔ Asynchronous 
        <br>Paint Night vs Community Library Stands
        <br>
        <br>
    <u>Social inertia:</u>
    <br>
        There exists a significant <b>social inertia</b> participating in a third place, especially if you are the first to do so. The inertia increases with the type of activity proposed, and how far it deviates outside of social norms and how deep that connection goes. Ie: 
        Kiss and ride opt in → lower social inertia, level of connection not that high
        Dancing with a stranger → extremely high social inertia. Level of connection is extremely high. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The option to Opt-In is important, the participants should self select to be in the activity.
        <br>
        <br>
        The offer and response should clearly lead to the experience from the start. ie: if it’s a random button that says “don’t push me”, and people push it to “opt-in”, they are not really choosing to opt-in. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Perhaps a lower inertia opt in, followed by prompting to higher and higher asks is a more effective way to opt in. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Unconventional third places in Vancouver:</u>
        <br>
        There are some common examples of third places that are often alluded to. But in our reimagining, we were curious about the new forms of the third space in our city, and inspired by how they facilitate interactions differently:
        <ul>
            <li>Kiss and ride sign (instead of drop off, 15 min parking sign)</li>
            <li>Run clubs</li>
            <li>Ballroom dancing at the Kits Show Boat or English Bay</li>
            <li><a href="https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/water-street-pedestrian-zone-pilot.aspx">The Gastown pedestrian’s way</a></li>

        </ul>

            How to Create Your Own Third Place
        </h2>
        <i>A Guide for building a Spontaneous, Pop-up Third Place that Disrupts Everyday Routine</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Our experiment</u>
        <br>
        We wanted to experiment with bringing strangers together to participate in an activity with a <b>high level of immediate connection</b> - dancing together. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Collective Effervescence - collective feeling of euphoria, unity, and heightened emotional states that occur when individuals are deeply immersed in a group experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Question</u>
        <br>
        Anywhere can be a third place 
        <br>
        → More specifically, you don’t need a physical space to create a third place, and it doesn’t need to be permanent for it to create connections 
        <br>
        <b>→ Can we create a third place, unlinked to a physical location, that creates ephemeral moments of connection between complete strangers?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Pathway:</u>
        <br>
        Offer → Opt in (Response) → Experience
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>The recipe:</u>

            <li>The right location

                    <ul> 
                    <li>Commuting
                    <li>Walking paths
                    </ul>
                </ul>
        </ol>

    <h2>The Debrief</h2>
    <u>What Happened:</u>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We were outside for around one hour
        </li>
        <li>
            Initially 5-6 people. Difficult to overcome the initial social inertia just us. Sweet spot
        </li>
        <li>
            We got a big group of our friends out around 2 PM, around 30 people 
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrapped up around 2:45 PM 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <u>Observations:</u>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>It was clear that the dancing was an ephemeral moment, and everyone who opted in knew that it was that.</b> Very much what you wanted to get out of it, some people stayed to chat, materializing into a more substantial connection. When we asked people to sign the poster, those who were in it for the fleeting moment were slightly taken aback, as if the permanent ask broke the magic of the fleeting connection that was shared for those moments. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            At first, <b>just one person dancing was not enough</b> to lower the social inertia for others to join.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>4-7 people was the sweet spot for this specific experience</b> - we had enough people that new joiners didn’t feel like they were on the spot, but not too many people that it was intimidating to join. Our dancing success rate here was ~20%, with a smile success rate of ~90%.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>But after a certain threshold there is a reverse correlation between the number of people already dancing and number of people willing to join.</b> But there was an “upper bound” on the number of people involved in the experience before people felt less encouraged to “opt-in.”
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Perhaps strangers were more hesitant on joining in because they thought we were all there for a specific event or purpose. This may be the “cliqueiness” that people refer to about friend groups in Vancouver as well 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    When our body language was closed as a group i.e. in a circle facing in with our backs to the world, nobody wanted to join even when we asked them if they wanted to join.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Specific to dance: very physical and spatial activity. You need everyone to be moving, dynamic, higher entropy, allows people more entrance points. less intimidating than everyone just standing around, even if they are grooving. More inviting when it’s a dynamic environment. Perhaps we can extrapolate to non-physical or spatial activities, but same sense of dynamic vs statics. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Taking videos took away from the experience</b> - people were less likely to stay as long or join at all when there was a phone camera out. This increased when we had the big professional cameras out. 
        </li>
    </ol>
