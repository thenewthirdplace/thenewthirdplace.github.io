        Our Proposition: Reimagining Third Places.
    </h2>
    <u>Dimensions of third places:</u>
        <br>

        Structured (Intentional) ↔ Unstructured (Unintentional)
        <br>
        Concert vs Cafe
        <br>
        <br>
        Linked to Physical Location ↔ Portable, Not Linked to Location
        <br>
        Beach vs Run Club
        <br>
        <br>
        Continuous, Consistent ↔ Spontaneous, Pop Up
        <br>
        Library vs Kiss and Ride
        <br>
        <br>
        Synchronous ↔ Async 
        <br>Paint Night vs Community Library Stands

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
    <u>Social Inertia</u>
    <br>
        There exists a significant social inertia participating in a third place, especially if you are the first to do so. The inertia increases with the type of activity proposed, and how far it deviates outside of social norms and how deep that connection goes. Ie: 
        Kiss and ride opt in -> lower social inertia, level of connection not that high
        Dancing with a stranger -> extremely high social inertia. Level of connection is extremely high. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The option to Opt-In is important, the participants should self select to be in the activity.
        <br>
        <br>
        The offer and response should clearly lead to the experience from the start. ie: if it’s a random button that says “don’t push me”, and people push it to “opt-in”, they are not really choosing to opt-in. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Perhaps a lower inertia opt in, followed by prompting to higher and higher asks is a more effective way to opt in. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Unconventional third places in Vancouver: 
        There are some common examples of third places that are often alluded to. But in our reimagining, we were curious about the new forms of the third space in our city, and inspired by how they facilitate interactions differently:
